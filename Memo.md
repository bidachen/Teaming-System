- Visitors can view top 3 ranked users and groups based on their score

- Visitors can register to our system by filling in some basic infomation, and if the visitor know someone in our system, they can put in his/her email as the referal to get an initial score. The Admin of our system can accept/reject the registered visitors. Visitors can choose to appeal if they got rejected.

-	If you don’t sign in and land in the website, you are considered as a visitor.

-	Any user who has a score greater than 30, it is considered as a VIP. 

-	SuperUser in our system has a credential of ID:test@test.com with PW:654321
-	And we have DSU that has a credential of ID:hlee011@citymail.cuny.edu with PW:654321

-	We have a landing page that displays data for top 3 user and project by pulling data from firebase for visitor 

-	Visitor can sign up to become a OU by filling personal info, it will need to be either approved or rejected by SU’s side in our system. After visitor gets approved, visitor will receive email with a link to change their password and all set to enjoy the system. 

-	If SU rejects the application once, visitor can send him appeal in the registration check section on the NavBar, and then it will be re-checked by SU. If SU declines the appeal again, the visitor will be put in blacklist. 

-	OU can form a group in the account section in our system, and at the same time s/he can invite other user by putting their emails. If it exists, invitation will be delivered to that user. Also, user can set other user into blacklist, and whitelist in our system. If OU puts some other user into blacklist, this OU will never see the invitation from that user. On the other hand, if OU puts some other user into whitelist, this OU will automatically accept and be in the group when he’s invited from that User. 

-	When you create a group, you can also put some private info about the group and it will not display as public. It is managed to save as private for group members only into our database. 

-	Any group member can set a polling for meeting time and this will be determined by the vote from all group member in group section inside the Account page.  Also you can make a list of task that needs to be done. If it’s done by a member of the group, you can mark as “finished by ‘username’”. And it will be displayed as finished task in the group page. 


-	Inside the group page, members can issue a warning or a praise to a group member and vote will be either yes or no without having voters’ names. We also have kick-out feature for group members to kick someone out from the group. And if any user gets score under 0, this user will be kicked out from the entire system automatically. 

- Group members can close the group by voting and VIP can evaluate group and determine a reputation score for every group member. 

- if OU gets score hire than 30, it will be promoted to VIP by database,
- and if VIP has a score less than 25, it will be demoted to OU by database.
